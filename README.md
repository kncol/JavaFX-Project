# Mario-menu-javaFX
A end-of-the-year college project where I created a program in JavaFX


This project utilizes JavaFX and SceneBuilder. The user will enter enter a ID number, first name, and last name, which they will submit with the button to the right. They will also have drop down options to choose what vehicle and character they would like to register as their own. Multiple competitors can be registered. The user can play test trials to set new racing times (these will be automatically generated). The user can then search for specific ids (and their corresponding records) and look at the leaderboards to what registered competitor is winning on each track!s
